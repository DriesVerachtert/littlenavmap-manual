## Tutorials {#tutorials}

### General {#tutorials-general}

The tutorials are based on:
* FSX or P3D scenery but can be easily adapted to X-Plane.
* An already loaded scenery database which normally happens right after the first startup.
* The stock navigation data of FSX or P3D. Differences might appear if you use navdata updates or airport scenery add-ons.

All functions will be referred by the names in the main menu by using `Menu Name` -&gt; `Menu Item`. The icons are shown as well, so you can find the buttons on one of the toolbars. Screenshots will provide more help.

### Quick Start

To have a clean common base, I recommend the following:

* Select `Window` -&gt; `Reset Window Layout` to get all the dock windows back into their default place.
* Use the map theme `OpenStreetMap` with hill shading ![Hill Shading](../images/icons/hillshading.png) enabled.
* Reset the map display settings in `Map` -&gt; `Reset Display Settings` to make sure that all needed features are shown on the map.
* Select `File` -&gt; `New Flight Plan` ![New Flight Plan](../images/icons/filenew.png) to start with a clean flight plan.
