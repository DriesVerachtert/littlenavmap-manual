General
~~~~~~~

The tutorials are based on: \* FSX or P3D scenery but can be easily
adapted to X-Plane. \* An already loaded scenery database which normally
happens right after the first startup. \* The stock navigation data of
FSX or P3D. Differences might appear if you use navdata updates or
airport scenery add-ons.

All functions will be referred by the names in the main menu by using
``Menu Name`` -> ``Menu Item``. The icons are shown too so you can find
the buttons on one of the toolbars. Screenshots will provide more help.

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

To have a clean common base I recommend the following:

-  Select ``Window`` -> ``Reset Window Layout`` to get all the dock
   windows back into their default place.
-  Use the map theme ``OpenStreetMap`` with hill shading |Hill Shading|
   enabled.
-  Reset the map display settings in ``Map`` ->
   ``Reset Display Settings`` to make sure that all needed features are
   shown on the map.
-  Select ``File`` -> ``New Flight Plan`` |New Flight Plan| to start
   with a clean flight plan.
