Printing
--------

.. _printing-the-map:

|Print Map| Print Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opens the print preview dialog allowing the current map view to be
printed.

Printing is currently limited to the screen resolution of the current
map view. To get a less blurry printout enlarge the map window as much
as possible. You can undock the map window to achieve this.

destination airport information.

The printed flight plan table will have the same order of columns as the
flight plan table in the dock window. Columns will be omitted from
printing if their width is reduced to minimum size. See `Table
View <SEARCH.html#table-view>`__ for more information.
