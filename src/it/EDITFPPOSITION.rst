Edit Flight Plan Position
-------------------------

This dialog allows to edit a user-defined flight plan position that was
added with |Add Position to Flight Plan| `Add Position to Flight
Plan <MAPDISPLAY.html#add-position-to-flight-plan>`__ or |Append Position
to Flight Plan| `Append Position to Flight
Plan <MAPDISPLAY.html#append-position-to-flight-plan>`__.

Name
~~~~

You can enter any string but all invalid characters will be removed when
saving as a FSX/P3D PLN file. Other file formats have more limitations.

Allowed are upper and lower case letters, digits, underscore ``_`` and
space. All other characters are removed when the flight plan is saved
and long names are truncated to 10 characters.

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also edit the coordinates directly in this dialog besides using
the drag and drop `Map Flight Plan Editing <MAPFPEDIT.html>`__. This can
be useful if you'd like to add waypoints with well known coordinates
like visual reporting points.

The tooltip of the coordinate input field shows the available formats.

See `Coordinate Formats <COORDINATES.html>`__ for more information.
