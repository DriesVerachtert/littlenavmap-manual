This dialog shows up after selecting a SID or STAR applicable for parallel runways or all runways.
Parallel runways are indicated in the :ref:`procedure-tree` by a list of runways like ``STAR  07L, 07R, 07C``.
The suffix ``All`` is added if a procedure applies to all runways of an airport.

The dialog header shows airport name and its ICAO ident as well as field elevation.

The list ``Runways`` shows available runways for the SID or the STAR. Columns are runway
name, length, width, magnetic heading, surface, lighting status and other attributes.
