Compass Rose
------------

The compass rose indicates true north, magnetic north, aircraft heading
and aircraft track.

User aircraft heading, track, distance rings and markers are shown if
*Little Navmap* is connected to a simulator. The rose is centered around
the user aircraft if connected.

The compass rose is kept centered in the current view if not connected
to a simulator. Magnetic declination is based on the declination in the
center.

The size is adapted to the map view size but not larger than 1000 nm and
not smaller than 4 nm.

Line thickness can be changed in dialog ``Options`` on the tab
``Map Display``.

Indicators
~~~~~~~~~~

|True North| True north.

|Magnetic North| Magnetic north.

|Distance Circles| Distance circles and marks from user aircraft if
connected.

|Aircraft Track| Solid line shows aircraft track in degrees magnetic if
connected.

|Aircraft Heading| Dashed line shows aircraft heading in degrees
magnetic if connected.
