General
~~~~~~~

All functions will be referred by the names in the main menu by using
``Menu Name`` -> ``Menu Item``. The icons are shown as well, so you can
find the buttons on one of the toolbars. Screenshots will provide more
help.

Screenshots were made on Linux and Windows. Therefore, look and feel
might be different.

See :doc:`INTRO` for general information about the user interface.

.. note::

    Flight plan distances, available procedures and airport names
    might differ between the simulators and used navdata cycles.

    Select the closest procedures or runways if they differ in your setup.

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

To have a clean common base, I recommend the following:

-  Select ``Window`` -> :ref:`reset-layout-menu` and :ref:`reset-tabs-menu` to get all the dock
   windows and tabs back into their default place.
-  Use the map theme ``OpenStreetMap`` in menu ``View`` -> :ref:`theme-menu`.
-  Reset the map display settings in ``View`` ->
   :ref:`reset-display-settings` to make sure that all needed features are shown on the map.
-  Select ``File`` -> :ref:`reset-for-new-flight` |Reset all for a
   new Flight| and check all buttons in the dialog to start with a clean
   flight plan table.
