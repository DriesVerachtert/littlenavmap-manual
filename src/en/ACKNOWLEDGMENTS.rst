generally pointing me into the right direction.

Vielen Dank and die Herren vom `FSC.ev <http://fsc-ev.de/>`__ für
Fehlerberichte, Vorschläge und neue Ideen!

Übersetzung der Anleitung.

Thank you, Björn for the idea with the automatic performance collection.

Plenty of thanks to `Hervé Sors <http://www.aero.sors.fr>`__ for
allowing me to include his updated ``magdecl.bgl`` file with *Little
Navmap*.

Thanks to all in the forums who patiently supported me and gave
invaluable feedback during the public beta:

`SimOuthouse <http://www.sim-outhouse.com>`__,
`FSDeveloper.com <https://www.fsdeveloper.com>`__.

Thanks to `AVSIM <https://www.avsim.com>`__ for kindly hosting the
support forum for *Little Navmap*.

This project and my library
`atools <https://github.com/albar965/atools>`__ would not exist without
the fabulous documentation of the BGL files in the `FSDeveloper
Wiki <https://www.fsdeveloper.com/wiki>`__. So, here a huge thank-you to
all the contributors.

Also a thank you to Ed Williams for his `Aviation
Formulary <http://www.edwilliams.org/>`__.

Without the open source `Marble <https://marble.kde.org>`__ widget that
allows me to access and display all the maps I would still be busy doing
that myself for years.

Let's not forget about all the services that provide us all the online
maps for free:

`Stamen Design <http://maps.stamen.com>`__,
`OpenTopoMap <https://www.opentopomap.org>`__ and
`CARTO <https://carto.com/>`__.

And last but not least: If there were no
`OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`__ and its thousands of
contributors none of us would have any maps at all.
