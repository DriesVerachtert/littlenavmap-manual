Issue Report
--------------------------------------------------------------

You can create a bug or issue report manually by selecting :ref:`create-issue-report` in the main menu ``Tools``.

This creates a Zip archive containing all relevant files needed to reproduce a problem.

Use this function if you wish to report a problem which might be only reproducible using your options and other files.

See :doc:`CRASHREPORT` for more information.
