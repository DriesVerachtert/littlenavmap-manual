Edit Flight Plan Position
-------------------------

This dialog allows to edit an user-defined flight plan position that was
added with |Add Position to Flight Plan| :ref:`add-position-to-flight-plan` or |Append Position
to Flight Plan| :ref:`append-position-to-flight-plan`.

Name
~~~~

You can enter any string but all invalid characters will be removed when
saving as a FSX/P3D PLN file. Other file formats have more limitations.

Allowed are upper and lower case letters, digits, underscore ``_`` and
space. All other characters are removed when the flight plan is saved
and long names are truncated to 10 characters.

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also edit the coordinates directly in this dialog besides using
the drag and drop :doc:`MAPFPEDIT`. This can
be useful if you'd like to add waypoints with well known coordinates
like visual reporting points.

The tooltip of the coordinate input field shows the available formats.

See :doc:`COORDINATES` for more information.
