Dock Windows
------------

The user interface of *Little Navmap* consists of a main window and
several dock windows which can be detached from the main window or
arranged within the main window.

The docked windows can be moved around in their docked position and can
be detached from the main window by simply dragging them outside of the
main window (click the title bar to drag), by double-clicking their
title bar or by clicking on the window symbol on the top right.

Double click on the docked window's title bar or click on the window
symbol again to move the windows back into their docked position
in the main window.

All docked windows, except the map window, can be closed if they are not
needed. You can also drop docked windows on each other to create a
tabbed view. The tabs will appear at the bottom of the dock stack in
this case.

Note that related dock windows open automatically when selecting functions like
``Show Information`` or clicking on the user aircraft, for example.

You can save and load dock window layouts in the ``Window`` menu. See also :doc:`LAYOUT` for
details.

**Dock window related menu items in menu** ``Window`` **:**

- :ref:`keep-foreground-menu`
- :ref:`show-all-floating`
- :ref:`allow-window-docking`
- :ref:`allow-window-moving`
- :ref:`show-dock-title-bars`

More dock window settings like auto activation on mouse over can be found in the options

.. tip::

    Hold ``Ctrl`` while clicking on the window title bar to prevent a window
    from going back into the docked state in the main window and keep it
    floating.

    You can also deselect ``Window`` -> :ref:`allow-window-docking` in the main menu to prevent the dock
    windows from snapping back into the main window.

.. note::

   Use the ``Window`` menu in the in the main menu to save, load or restore
   closed windows, toolbars and tabs.

   The  menu item :ref:`reset-layout-menu` in the menu ``Window`` can be used to reset the state and positions of all dock
   windows and toolbars back to their default.

   Use :ref:`reset-tabs-menu` to reset the tab visibility and order back to default.
