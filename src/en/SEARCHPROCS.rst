|Search| Search Procedures
----------------------------------------

The tab ``Procedures`` allows previewing and adding approach and
departure procedures to the flight plan. Procedures of a selected
airport are arranged in a tree which indicates the dependencies between
approaches and transitions.

See :doc:`APPROACHES` for general information about SID,
STAR, approaches and transitions.

Note that the SID and STAR names are limited to 5 characters in FSX and
P3D due to a limitation in the BGL file format. Therefore procedure
names are slightly modified. However, this does not apply to procedures
from a Navigraph or X-Plane scenery database.

**See the** :ref:`delete-selected-legs` **chapter of this manual for more details.**

Procedure legs are shown when a procedure node is expanded in the tree.
Procedures can be filtered by runway and type.

Right-click on a procedure to get more options in the context menu, like
centering the map on the procedure or adding it to your flight plan.

Use the context menu of the flight plan table to remove procedures. See :ref:`delete-selected-legs`.

Procedure legs are highlighted in red if one or more navaids could not
be resolved. A warning dialog will be displayed if you try to add this
procedure to a flight plan.

.. note::

    It is up to the user to combine the correct procedures.

    *Little Navmap* will not keep you from choosing north bound procedures for a route going south, for example.
    Also check the resulting route to avoid accidental zig-zag routing which can happen if you combine the wrong
    approach/transition with a STAR, for example.

       endpoint of a transition leg are highlighted on the map.

Procedure Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Legs are shown in dark blue while missed approach legs are shown in dark
red color.

Bold red text indicates an error in the leg. The procedure is incomplete
and should not be used in a flight plan. *Little Navmap* might refuse to use the procedure depending on the error since inconsistencies can result in crashes.

-  ``Remarks``: Either description of the procedure or flight
   instruction for procedure legs.
-  ``Course Â°M``: Magnetic course for a leg.
-  ``Dist./Time``: Distance of flying time for a leg. Holds can have a
   leg time in minutes or a leg distance in NM.
-  ``Ident``: Ident of the initial fix or name of the procedure. Fix
   name for legs.
-  ``Restriction``: Either minimum altitude for en-route airway segment,
   procedure altitude restriction or procedure speed limit. A ``/``
   separates altitude and speed restriction. The following altitude
   restrictions exist for procedures:

   -  **Number only:** Fly at altitude or speed. Example: ``5,400`` or
      ``210``.
   -  **Prefix** ``A``: Fly at or above altitude or speed. Example:
      ``A 1,800``.
   -  **Prefix** ``B``: Fly at or below altitude or speed. Example:
      ``B 10,000`` or ``B 220``.
   -  **Range:** Fly at or above altitude one and at or below altitude
      two. Example: ``A 8,000, B 10,000``.
   -  **Altitude and speed limit:** Values separated by ``/``. Example:
      ``A 8,000, B 10,000/B220``.
   -  **Speed limit only:** A prefixed ``/`` indicates no altitude but a
      speed restriction. Example: ``/B250``.

-  ``Remarks``: Shows fly-over, turn direction or related navaid for a
   procedure leg.

.. _procedure-filter-type:

Type Filter (All Procedures)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The type filter is not available for an FSX or P3D stock database.

This filter is always available for a X-Plane database which contains
SIDs and STARs already in the stock data.

The type filter allows the selections below:

-  ``All Procedures``: SID, STAR and approaches
-  ``Departure Procedures``: Only SID
-  ``Arrival Procedures``: STAR and approaches
-  ``Only Approaches and Transitions``: No SID and no STAR

The respective transitions are always shown.

.. _procedure-filter-runway:

Runway Filter (All Runways)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This filter is always available and helps to find procedures for a
certain departure or arrival runway.

.. _clear-selection-button-procs:

|Clear Selection| Clear Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deselect all entries in the table and remove any highlight circles from
the map.

.. _help-procs:

|Help| Help
^^^^^^^^^^^

Open this chapter of the manual in the default browser.

.. _procedure-context-menu:

Context Menu Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _procedure-show-on-map:

|Show on Map| Show on Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Center the map on the selected procedure.

Follow Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The map view will be zoomed on the selected procedure when this function
is enabled.

.. _procedure-insert:

|Insert into Flight Plan / Use as Destination / Use as Departure| Insert into Flight Plan, Use as Destination and Use as Departure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Text and functionality of this menu item depends on the selected
procedure type and whether the procedure's airport is already the
departure or destination airport of the current flight plan.

Use the context menu of the flight plan table or the map to remove procedures. See
:ref:`delete-selected-legs` and :ref:`delete-from-flight-plan`.

If a transition is selected, the corresponding procedure (approach, SID
or STAR) is added or replaced as well.

``Insert ... into Flight Plan``:

This menu item will add the selected procedure to the current flight
plan. A procedure of the same type (SID, STAR or approach with or
without transition) will be replaced if already present in the flight
plan.

``Use ... as Destination`` or ``Use ... as Departure``:

This will add or replace the destination or departure airport and add
the selected procedure.

If the flight plan is empty, the departure or destination airport is
added to the flight plan as well.

A leg entry will drawn red if a navaid was not resolved during the
scenery database loading process. This happens only when the source data
is not valid or incomplete. In this case, the resulting procedure is not
usable and a warning dialog will be shown if essential navaids are
missing.

*Little Navmap* might refuse to use the procedure depending on error.


.. _show-information-procs:

|Show Information for Airport| Show Information for Airport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
