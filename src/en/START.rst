First Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Little Navmap* shows various dialogs on first start to give hints for better usage. You can dismiss these dialogs
for future starts by pressing ``Do not show again`` but keep at least the message in mind.

#.  You have to load the scenery library first to see the airports of your simulator. Go to main
    menu ``Scenery Library`` and select :ref:`load-scenery-library`.
    Select your simulator and click ``Load``.
    Also have a look at :ref:`scenery-library-menu`, :doc:`SCENERY` and :doc:`NAVDATA` about the different
    scenery library modes which can be selected in the menu.
#.  Build a flight plan. Right click into the map on an airport and select departure (:ref:`set-as-flight-plan-departure`),
    destination (:ref:`set-as-flight-plan-destination`) and intermediate
    waypoints (:ref:`add-position-to-flight-plan` and :ref:`append-position-to-flight-plan`) from the context menu.
#.  Save the flight plan into *Little Navmap*'s own format LNMPLN by clicking :ref:`save-flight-plan`.
    This file format is only for *Little Navmap* and allows to keep all flight plan features like remarks,
    user defined approaches and more. Do not try to load it into simulators or other tools.
#.  Configure the flight plan export in menu ``File`` -> :ref:`multiexport-flight-plan-options`.
    Select desired formats by clicking one or more checkboxes on the left and adapt the paths and filenames
    for export. See :doc:`ROUTEEXPORTALL`.
#.  Select ``File`` -> :ref:`multiexport-flight-plan` to export your flight plan for simulator, tools or
    aircraft.
#.  Connect *Little Navmap* to your flight simulator.
    Go to main menu ``Tools`` -> :ref:`flight-simulator-connection`,
    choose your simulator and click ``Connect``. See :doc:`CONNECT` for more information.
#.  You probably see a few warning messages in *Little Navmap* about missing aircraft performance
    information. Ignore these for now.

See in the menu ``Help`` -> :doc:`TUTORIALS` if you're new to *Little Navmap*.
