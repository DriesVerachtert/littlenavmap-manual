*Little Navmap* can display an airport traffic patterns for guidance on
the map.

Right click at the center of an airport symbol in the map, flight plan table or airport

This will show a dialog where you can select a runway and customize the
pattern.

The display of traffic patterns is automatically enabled in menu ``View`` -> ``User Features`` ->
:ref:`user-traffic-patterns` after using this function.

*Little Navmap* shows a tooltip with information about the traffic
pattern when hovering the mouse above the hotspot (white filled circle)
at runway threshold.

Traffic patterns can be removed by either selecting ``Map`` ->
:ref:`remove-traffic-patterns`, ``File`` -> :ref:`reset-for-new-flight` or by right click on
the hotspot (circle) at the runway threshold.
