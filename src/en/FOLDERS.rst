Directories
------------

*Little Navmap* suggests to create a recommended directory structure on startup. This is purely optional. You can choose to ignore this
and save your *Little Navmap* files in arbitrary places. The program does not require a fixed directory structure for its files.

All default directories are adjusted if you allow *Little Navmap* to create the directory
structure. This means that file dialogs will initially point to the right place when saving files.

The following folders are suggested to be created:

-  ``Flight Plans``: For flight plans in *Little Navmap*'s own format LNMPLN. See :doc:`ROUTEEXPORTALL` for
   exporting flight plans to other formats usable by simulators, aircraft or tools. See also
   :ref:`flight-plan-formats-lnmpln` for information about this format.
-  ``Aircraft Performance``: Directory for aircraft performance files LNMPERF. See :doc:`AIRCRAFTPERF` for
   more information.
-  ``Window Layouts``: For saved window layouts LNMLAYOUT. See :doc:`LAYOUT` or :doc:`DOCKWINDOWS`.
-  ``Airports``: A place to store PDF, text, image or other files that are linked in the airport
   information. Chapter :ref:`airport-files` gives more information about this feature.
-  ``User Airspaces``: User defined airspaces in OpenAir format. See :doc:`SCENERY`.
-  ``GLOBE Elevation Data``: A place for the GLOBE data used by the flight plan elevation profile.
   Look at chapter See :ref:`cache-elevation` for installation instructions.

.. note::

      The directory names depend on the chosen user interface language. This dialog might pop up
      again if you change the language. Ignore it in this case.

      See options on page :ref:`user-interface` for information how to change the program language.
