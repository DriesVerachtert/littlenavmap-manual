Edit Flight Plan Remarks
-------------------------

This dialog allows to add a remark to any flight plan waypoint which is not an alternate and not a
part of a procedure.

The information entered here is saved with the flight plan in the *Little Navmap* LNMPLN format (:ref:`flight-plan-formats-lnmpln`).

Keep in mind that all information entered here is lost if the flight plan position is removed or a
new flight plan is calculated (:doc:`ROUTECALC`).
