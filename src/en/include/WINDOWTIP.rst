.. tip::

     You can use ``Window`` -> :ref:`reset-layout-menu` if the main window of *Little Navmap* is not or only partially visible.
     Activate the main window of *Little Navmap* by either clicking on the visible part or by using the ``Alt+Tab`` function
     of your operating system. The window only needs to be active and not visible.

     Then press the shortcut ``Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W`` to reset the window layout which brings the main window back on screen.
