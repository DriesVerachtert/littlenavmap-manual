.. tip::

  First, see `Safely open apps on your Mac <https://support.apple.com/HT202491>`__ for more information.

  There are several tools available which can help to circumvent the Apple Gatekeeper restrictions:

  - `Mac OS - CleanUp Quarantine Flags <https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/79828-mac-os-cleanup-quarantine-flags/>`__: Download this from x-plane.org, place it in the X-Plane base folder and run it to clean up the flags on all plugins at once.
  - `Sentinel <https://github.com/alienator88/Sentinel>`__: Use this to clear the quarantine flag of *Little Navmap* or the plugin by drag and dropping *Little Navmap* on the tool's window.
  - `Drop Quarantine for MacOS (Big Sur+) <https://forums.x-plane.org/files/file/77523-drop-quarantine-for-macos-big-sur/>`__: An Applescript application which removes quarantine flag from files.
