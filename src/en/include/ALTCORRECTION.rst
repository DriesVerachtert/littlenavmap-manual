.. note::

    Keep in mind that actual altitude shown in *Little Navmap* might differ from indicated altitude even with a correct baro setting.

    This is an effect of the outside air temperature (OAT) on actual altitude where low temperatures affect the aircraft altimeter.
    When temperature is less than ISA conditions an aircraft will be lower than the altimeter reading.

    This effect is currently modeled in X-Plane 12 and MSFS.

    Corrections have to be applied when the aerodrome temperature is 0Â°C or colder:

    -  DH/DA or MDH/MDA and step-down fixes inside the final approach fix (FAF).
    -  All low altitude approach procedure altitudes in mountainous regions (terrain of 3000 ft AMSL or higher)

    for more information.
