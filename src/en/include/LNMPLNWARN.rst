.. warning::

   Always save a copy in the default LNMPLN format before exporting to other
   formats. This allows *Little Navmap* to restore all flight plan
   properties like procedures, alternate airports and remarks.

   Note that the LNMPLN format is only understood by *Little Navmap*.
   Do not try to load it into simulators or add-ons.
