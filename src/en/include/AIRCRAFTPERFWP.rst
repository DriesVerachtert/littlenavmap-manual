.. note::

  You can also use the performance collection without a flight plan. In this case, ensure that you set the cruise altitude
  in the flight plan window (:ref:`flight-plan-altitude`) to the intended cruise altitude. This allows *Little Navmap* to detect
  the cruise portion of the flight once the altitude is reached by the aircraft.
