.. important::

  Directories like ``C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData`` (Windows), ``/Users/YOURUSERNAME/.config`` (macOS) or
  ``/home/YOURUSERNAME/.config`` (Linux) are hidden by default in file managers like Windows Explorer or Apple Finder.
  Refer to the file manager documentation or search the Internet to find out how to make hidden files visible in your OS.

  Opening the files or directories from menu ``Tools`` -> :ref:`files-and-directories` circumvents this limitation.
