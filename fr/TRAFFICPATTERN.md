* `Turn direction`: Select to choose between left or right turn pattern. This is automatically updated when selecting a runway from FSX or P3D.
* `Base 45Â° after threshold`: Calculates the final leg length automatically when checked.
* `Base leg to runway threshold`: Length of the final leg. Measured from turn to final to the runway threshold.
* `Downwind to runway`: Parallel distance from downwind leg to runway.
* `Pattern altitude`: Pattern altitude above airport elevation. This is automatically updated when selecting a runway from FSX or P3D.
* `Entry and exit indicators`: Shows dashed lines and arrows giving hints for entry and exit points.
* `Line Color`: Color of the pattern lines and labels.

Traffic patterns can be removed by either selecting `Map` -&gt; `Remove all Ranges, Measurements and Patterns` or by right click on the hotspot \(circle\) at the runway threshold.
