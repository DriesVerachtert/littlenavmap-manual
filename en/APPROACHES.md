## Procedures

### Glossary

* **Procedures:** in the following used for approaches, transitions, SIDs and STARs.
* **Fix:** This term refers to a waypoint, radio navaid or an calculated point on a procedure.
* **Initial Fix:** This is the first fix of a procedure.

### General

SIDs and STARs are not fully supported yet. You can look at them but you have to add them manually to the flight plan, waypoint by waypoint.

Transitions make only sense together with an approach which will guide you to the runway. You can select a transition only together with an approach.

Saving of approaches with a flight plan is not implemented since it does not make sense. The PLN format does not support all the different leg types and the flight simulator would show only a bunch of weird lines. Select the approach in your GPS or FMC if you need it there. The same applies for the PMDG RTE format where PMDG decided to ignore saved procedures completely for other reasons.

Legs are pre-calculated except holds and procedure turns. This means you can fly them mostly as they are drawn on the map. If in doubt about how to fly a leg \(e.g. if too many lines overlap\) look at the procedure table in the flight plan window.

* **Holds:** No entry or exit is shown. You have to find a proper entry procedure yourself. Holds have a flying time in minutes or a distance. If time is given you fly the hold as usual. Enter at the fix, standard turn, straight leg for the given time \(often one minute\), standard turn and so on. Do not follow the lines slavish. 
* **Procedure turns:** The flight simulator data moves the turn point of a procedure turn 10 nautical miles out from the fix which is usually too far away. Fly the turn as usual: Minimum one minute from the fix. Use more if you need space to catch the next leg after the course reversal. Then turn using an teardrop or a standard 45/180 degree turn. Again: Follow the procedures and not the lines.
* **Distances**: Holds and procedure turns do not count in flying distance while all others legs do. This means the total flight plan distance as well as the top of descent point will change when selecting an approach or a transition. Altitude restrictions are not yet considered when calculating the top of descent.

### Attaching an Procedure to a Flight Plan

There is no concept of adding all fixes of a procedure to a flight plan in _Little Navmap_. The original flight plan will not be changed with the exception of adding the initial fix of a procedure to the nearest flight plan leg.

Attaching a procedure to a flight plan can be done by simply using the menu item `Attach Initial Fix to Flight Plan`. It does not matter how this is done. You could also use the context menu on the map or the drag and drop editing to add the initial fix manually.

The following will happen if a procedure is attached to a flight plan:

1. All flight plan waypoints after the initial fix will be shown gray in the flight plan window. The grayed out waypoints can be still edited, though.
2. Flight plan legs after the initial fix are hidden on the map.
3. All distances including the top of descent point are recalculated considering the approach.
4. The active leg will follow the procedure after the initial fix instead of the flight plan.
5. The procedure tree turns into a table showing all procedure legs. Legs are highlighted only in this view when flying a procedure.

Attaching can be undone by deleting the initial fix from the flight plan.

### Fix Types in a Procedure

* **Waypoints:** Terminal waypoints or radio navaids. Some are marked as `flyover` in the approach table.
* **Radial and distance:** Example: `WIK/7nm/291Â°M`. A fix defined by a radial and distance to a navaid.
* **Distance to DME:** Example: `WIK/9nm`. This fix is defined by a heading or track which is terminated by reaching a DME distance.
* **Intercept Course to Fix:** Intercept a course to the next fix at an angle of about 45 degrees.
* **Intercept Leg:** Intercept the next approach leg at a course of about 45 degrees.
* **Altitude:** A leg or hold that is terminated by reaching a certain altitude and is used mostly on missed approaches. Since the distance depends on the aircraft 2 nautical miles length are used for this leg. You can ignore the line and proceed to the next leg once the altitude criteria is satisfied.
* **Manual:** Fly a heading, track or a hold until manually terminated by ATC.

### Altitude Restrictions

* **Number only:** Fly at altitude. Example: `5400ft`.
* **Prefix **`A`**:** Fly at or above altitude. Example: `A1800ft`.
* **Prefix **`B`**:** Fly at or below altitude. Example: `B10000ft`.
* **Range:** Fly at or above altitude one and at or below altitude two. Example: `A8000B10000ft`.

### Related Navaids

Most fixes have a related or recommended navaid. This can be a VOR, NDB, ILS or a waypoint. The related navaid comes with radial and distance values that can be used to locate waypoints when flying without GPS.
