### General {#tutorials-general}

The tutorials are based on an already loaded scenery database which normally happens right after the first startup. Furthermore they are based on the stock navigation data of FSX or P3D. Differences might appear if you use navdata updates or airport scenery add-ons.

All functions will be referred by the names in the main menu by using `Menu Name` -&gt; `Menu Item`. The icons are shown too so you can find the buttons on one of the toolbars. Screenshots will provide more help.

To have a common window layout I recommend to select `Window` -&gt; `Reset Window Layout` and use the map theme `OpenStreetMap` with hill shading ![Hill Shading](../images/icons/hillshading.png) enabled. This provides a common base and avoids getting lost. Also reset the map display settings in `Map` -&gt; `Reset Display Settings` to make sure that all needed features are shown on the map.

Select `File` -&gt; `New Flight Plan` ![New Flight Plan](../images/icons/filenew.png) to start with a clean flight plan.
