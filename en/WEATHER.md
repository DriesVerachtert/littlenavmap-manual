_Little Navmap_ can display METARs from four sources:

TODO FS Weather
*   [NOAA](http://www.weather.gov) online weather service
*   [VATSIM](http://www.vatsim.net) network online weather service
*   [HiFi Simulation Technologies](http://www.hifisimtech.com) _Active Sky Next_
*   [HiFi Simulation Technologies](http://www.hifisimtech.com) _AS16_

You can define in the `Options` dialog on the `Weather` tab which sources are used to display the METAR information in tooltips or the `Information` dock window.

Both Active Sky programs are recognized automatically on startup for each simulator. The `current_wx_snapshot.txt` file is loaded and monitored for changes.

You can also select the `current_wx_snapshot.txt` file manually. In that case the METARs from this file are displayed for all installed flight simulators.
