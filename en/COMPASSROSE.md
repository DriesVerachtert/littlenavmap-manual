## Compass Rose {#compass-rose}

The compass rose indicates true north, magnetic north, aircraft heading and aircraft track.

User aircraft heading, track, distance rings and markers are shown if _Little Navmap_ is connected to a simulator. The rose is centered around the user aircraft if connected.

The compass rose is kept centered in the current view if not connected to a simulator. Magnetic declination is based on the declination in the center.

The size is adapted to the map view size but not larger than 1000 nm and not smaller than 4 nm.

Line thickness can be changed in dialog `Options` on the tab `Map Display`.
