## 3D

X-Plane airport which contains at least one 3D object. May be a fully constructed major airport.

## Add-on airport
This is an airport that was found outside the Flight Simulator default scenery folder when loading the database.

## Arrival Procedure
Approach, transition or STAR procedure.

## BGL
A binary file with the extension `BGL` which is part of a flight simulator scenery containing airport, navaid or airway information. These files can also contain traffic, landclass, elevation or other information which is not relevant for _Little Navmap_.

## CSV
Comma-separated values text file.

## DAT
A text file format used by X-Plane to store airport, navaid and procedure information.

## Departure Procedure
SID procedure.

## DME
Distance measuring equipment or a radio navaid.

## Empty airport
An airport that has no taxiways, no parking positions or gates, no aprons and is not an add-on airport and is not a water airport.

## FACF
Final approach course fix. A point aligned on the final approach course of an instrument procedure.

## FAF
Final approach fix. The point where the final approach segment begins on the instrument approach.

## Fix
This term refers to a waypoint, radio navaid or an calculated point on a procedure.

## Flight Plan Position
A user-defined waypoint which is part of the flight plan.

## FLP
Flight plan format used by the X-Plane FMS, Aerosoft Airbus and other add-on aircraft.

## FMS
X-Plane flight plan format.

## FS9
Flight Simulator 2004.

## FSX
Flight Simulator X or Flight Simulator - Steam Edition.

## GIS
A geographical information system like Google Earth for example.

## ILS
Instrument landing system.

## Initial Fix
This is the first fix of a procedure.

## MAP
Missed approach point. The point on the final approach which represents the termination of the final approach and the start of the missed approach.

## Navaid
VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB or waypoint/intersection.

## NDB
Non directional beacon - radio navaid.

## P3D
Prepar3D v2 to v4.

## Parking
GA ramp, cargo ramp, fuel box or gate.

## PLN
FSX and P3D flight plan format. Can save all information in flight plans using annotations.

## POI
General point of interest. A userpoint type.

## Radio navaid
VOR, VORTAC, TACAN or NDB.

## Rating
Airport zero to five star rating depending on facilities.

## Scenery Library Database
This is an internal database \([SQLite](http://sqlite.org)\) that is created by _Little Navmap_ when reading all the flight simulator BGL or DAT files. It allows fast complex searches and map display.

## SID
Standard instrument departure.

## SimConnect
A programming interface that allows applications to read and write flight simulator parameters.

## STAR
Standard terminal arrival procedure. Usually followed by a transition and an approach.

## Start position
Used for departure in flight plans. Either runway, helipad, GA ramp, cargo ramp, fuel box or gate.

## TACAN
Tactical air navigation system - radio navaid used by military aircraft.

## TOC
Top of climb.

## TOD
Top of descent.

## VOR
VHF Omni Directional Radio Range - radio navaid.

## VORDME
VHF Omni Directional Radio Range with distance measuring equipment- radio navaid.

## VORTAC
Co-located VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) beacon.

## Userpoint
A user-defined waypoint like a bookmark, point of interest or visual reporting point \(VRP\).

## VRP
Visual reporting point for VFR flights. A userpoint type.
