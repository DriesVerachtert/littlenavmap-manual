## Edit Flight Plan Position {#edit-flightplan-position}

This dialog allows to edit an user-defined flight plan position that was added with ![Add Position to Flight Plan](../images/icons/routeadd.png "Add Position to Flight Plan") [Add Position to Flight Plan](MAPDISPLAY.md#add-position-to-flight-plan) or ![Append Position to Flight Plan](../images/icons/routeadd.png "Append Position to Flight Plan") [Append Position to Flight Plan](MAPDISPLAY.md#append-position-to-flight-plan).

### Name

You can enter any string but all invalid characters will be removed when saving as a FSX/P3D PLN file. Other file formats have more limitations.

Allowed are upper and lower case letters, digits, underscore `_` and space. All other characters are removed when the flight plan is saved and long names are truncated to 10 characters.

### Coordinates

You can also edit the coordinates directly in this dialog besides using the drag and drop [Map Flight Plan Editing](MAPFPEDIT.md). This can be useful if you'd like to add waypoints with well known coordinates like visual reporting points.

The tooltip of the coordinate input field shows the available formats.

See [Coordinate Formats](COORDINATES.md) for more information.
