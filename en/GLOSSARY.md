## Scenery Library Database
This is an internal database \([SQLite](http://sqlite.org)\) that is created by _Little Navmap_ when reading all the flight simulator BGL files. It allows fast complex searches and map display.

## BGL
A binary file with the extension `BGL` which is part of a flight simulator scenery containing airport, navaid or airway information. These files can also contain traffic, landclass, elevation or other information which is not relevant for _Little Navmap_.

## Navaid
VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB or waypoint/intersection.

## Radio navaid
