## Information Dock Window {#information-dock-window}

![Information](../images/icons/infodock.png "Information")

This dock window contains text information about airports in several tabs as well as information for one or more navaids or airways in another tab. Also, included are the legend for the navigation symbols and the general map legend which depends on the selected map theme.

All information can be copied into the clipboard as formatted text. Use the context menu of the text fields or use `Ctrl-A` to select all and `Ctrl-C` to copy the content to the clipboard.

Note that the airport and airport related tabs are preferred. So, when you click on an airport and a navaid, the airport tab is shown. The navaid tab is also filled in this case but the airport tab is pulled to the foreground.

A link `Map` allows jumping to the shown airport or navaid on the map.

## Simulator Aircraft Dock Window {#simulator-aircraft-dock-window}

This dock window shows information similar to a flight management computer about the user aircraft. _Little Navmap_ has to be connected to the simulator to enable this functionality. The dock window contains one tab that shows general aircraft data like gross weight and another tab that displays flight data, flight plan progress, weather and ambient parameters.

See [Connecting to a Flight Simulator](CONNECT.md#connecting-to-a-flight-simulator) for more information on this topic.
