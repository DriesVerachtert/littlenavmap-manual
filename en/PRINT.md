## Printing {#printing}

### ![Print Map](../images/icons/printmap.png "Print Map") Print Map {#printing-the-map}

Opens the print preview dialog allowing the current map view to be printed.

Printing is currently limited to the screen resolution  
of the current map view. To get a less blurry printout enlarge the map window as much as possible. You  
can undock the map window to achieve this.
