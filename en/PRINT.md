## Printing {#printing}

### ![Print Map](../images/icons/printmap.png "Print Map") Print Map{#printing-the-map}

Opens the print preview dialog that allows the current map view to be printed.

Printing is currently limited to the screen resolution
of the current map view. To get a less blurry printout enlarge the map window as much as possible. You
can close all dock windows to achieve this.
